# LoginApp
an app that logs you in

This was a simple app that really helped me learn how to develop a mobile app. It was my first experience with mobile app development. I built the app using React Native and used firebase for a backend database. I also used Expo to run and test the app. To get the app to work, please clone the repo and run 'npm install'. To run the app please use 'npx expo start' and download Expo Go on an android or iphone to scan the QR code and run the app.
